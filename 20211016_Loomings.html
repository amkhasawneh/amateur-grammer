    Loomings!

This is the beginning of the journey. I have never made a website before, needless to say. I have not even started learning web development, but I am hereby establishing a
kind of <i>baseline</i>. I go from almost zero knowledge to (hopefully) more than that...

I have the following resources at hand, and shall start using them in November:
1. The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy.
2. The Odin Project.

I have no experience in any of these topics, but I'm not a complete stranger to programming. I have been learning R for the past six months or so. I still do not consider myself
"good" at it, but I think I have an opportunity to improve. 

I have just been offered a position as a research assistant (or something), and part of the job description is building a database with patient information. I have a healthcare background
(kind of), and this will be a good entry point into health data science. (This is an unofficial name). Also, part of the description is making/updating a website for the department,
so it's not just personal improvement that's going on here!

I am writing this on October 16, 2021, using Visual Studio Code 1.60.2 (it updated to 1.61.1).
Ciao for now.
