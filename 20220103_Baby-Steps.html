    <h1>Baby Steps</h1>
    <h3><i>January 3, 2022</i></h3>
    <p>So I have finally begun the journey. I have been learning quite a lot on Udemy these last few days. We have moved
        to another place, because I got a (new) job, and I have been busy
        with work stuff for 2 months or so. This has probably taken some time I could have used to learn more
        programming, but that's OK; I have also been learning another kind of
        programming at work.</p>
    <p>So, in addition to using the R programming language, my humble Bash skills have come in very handy. I will work
        on improving those, and I have some very good resources&#8212books
        and video courses. It seems I will have to learn good Linux administration skills, both of Debian and Red Hat
        systems.
    </p>
    <p>I will also need to really improve my R skills, especially as it is used in bioinformatics; Biocondoctor is
        especially important. I think I will need to learn how to better use
        R without an IDE&#8212that is, directly on the command line. A few months ago, this would have been an
        intimidating notion; now, I'm excited by it. I'll just need to find a good
        resource, and I think I already have one. <a

    <p>I'll do my best!</p>
