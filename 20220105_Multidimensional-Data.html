    <h1>Multidimensional Data</h1>
    <h2>The Accidental Bioinformatician - Part 1</h2>
    <h3><i>January 5, 2022</i></h3>

    <p>In April (of last year), I started learning the R programming language. I had been interested in (bio)statistics
        for a year or so, and had been reading
        <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1037459#:~:text=Intuitive%20Biostatistics%20covers%20all%20the,for%20students%20to%20understand%20both.">Intuitive
            Biostatistics</a>
        by Harvey Motulsky. (A very good book, by the way). Getting started with R made me like what is called "data
        science". I even started looking for "data science" jobs, which caused me excitement and anxiety for a few
        months.
    </p>
    <p>After R, I got interested in SQL, of course; but my knownledge has not reached a level high enough for me to
        write that as a skill I have on my CV. A few months afterwards, my interest
        in Linux was reignited. I took an introductory course on Udemy, by Colt Steele, and liked it and did quite
        well. After that, I took the Bash scritping course by Ziyad Yehya, on Udemy too.
        Both of these gave me very good skills, which turned out to be essential in my new role.
    </p>
    <p>Well, as it transpires, we have to use a alignment software (Cell Ranger) that only works in Linux. Admittedly,
        I struggled at first, but that was because I was using Ubuntu.
        I like this distro, to be honest, especially the packages and ease of use, but it seems Cell Ranger works best
        in Red Hat (or something based on it). So we had to install CentOS 8
        on a good computer we had sitting at the lab, and it worked just fine. After alignment, we use R for
        statistical analysis and visualization of the data, which would also require
        that I learn how to use the Biocondoctor Project's tools and packages. I will get back to those later, as I
        learn them step by step.
    </p>
    <p>So it seems I will have to learn some Linux administration, just for fun. I can't wait! This is a great
        opportunity, because I believe the best kind of knowledge&#8212the kind that sticks with you&#8212is the kind
        that you use and have a purpose for.
        So I will have to learn Linux administration in general, and Red Hat in particular. There seems to be a sizable
        difference. I'm already considering taking some Linux certificate
        somewhere along the line.</p>
    <p>Of course, I should not neglect the biological side of things. I need to learn/revise some molecular biology, and
        it seems genetics might come in handy too. I am currently reading
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51575008-an-introduction-to-statistical-genetic-data-analysis">An
            Introduction to Statistical Genetic Data Analysis</a>, which
        might be good for a starting point. Later on, I might read the heavy tome
