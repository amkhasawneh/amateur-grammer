    <h1>On CSS</h1>
    <h2>What CSS is, and what CSS isn't, hopefully</h2>
    <h3>January 16, 2022</h3>
    <p>So I have finally reached a milestone in my journey of developing the web&#8212i.e., Cascading Style Sheets.
        To use a style sheet, you have to link it in the HTML file's head.<sp>*</sp>  Not
        a particularly difficult task.I have started learning how to manipulate text: change font using
        the
        "font-family" property, "font-weight" to change boldness, and, most importantly,
        "text-align" to align&#8212ahem&#8212text (to the center, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
        With the excitement comes some worry, though. CSS is just so immense I'm
        afraid it will take me a very long time to learn. But hey, I have that.
    </p>
    <p>And so it is that this is the first post that will have a css file attached to it.
        I will link this file to all coming posts, but I will be constantly changing
        the styles until the website has at least an esthetically acceptable look.
    </p>

    <footer>
        <sp>*</sp>It has to be pointed out that this is <i>one</i>, not the <i>only</i> way of doing it.
