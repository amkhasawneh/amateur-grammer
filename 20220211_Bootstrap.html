    <h1>To Bootstrap or not to?</h1>
    <h2>A tool that feels like cheating</h2>
    <h3>February 11, 2022</h3>
    <p>I have finished the part of the web development course that discusses CSS.
        I have even received a LinkedIn badge(Which is useless, really)! The next step
        is simply diving into JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        But before that, I have to consider whether the last section on CSS was
        important. It's about the framework "Bootstrap". Simply put, it's a way
        of using pre-made categories of elements, using characterized by CSS <i>classes</i>,
        that preclude the need to actually type in the CSS code yourself.
    </p>
    <p>I think I'll try it out here. I'll try to make a "comment" form down below.
        If I like this framework, I think I might use it to improve the general layout
        of this "website". So here goes...

    <form action="">
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="name">Was yo' name?</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="I is... ">
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="comment">Whatcha want now?</label>
            <textarea type="text" class="form-control form-control-lg" id="comment" placeholder="Mhm?"></textarea>
        </div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <footer>
        PS: it looks terrible.
