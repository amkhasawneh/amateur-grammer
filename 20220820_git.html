    <h1>Gotta Git Going</h1>
    <h2>A True Game-Changer</h2>
    <h3>August 20, 2022</h3>
    <p>Yesterday, I finished the Git and GitHub course by Colt Steele on Udemy. (I highly recommend this course, by the way.) Would that I'd known earlier what a great tool Git is! Every since I started learning
        it, I have been using it at work, for downstream single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) analysis, mainly using the R language. Maybe I should write more
        about that in detail later.
    </p>
    <p>
        To me, the most interesting thing in Git, apart from the real work it does, is that it gives me a sense of achievement,
        and a way to mark progress. I have been also <i>pushing</i> my work on to GitHub (privately) to get a better understanding and 
        experience with remote repositories. I am around 25% into the Pro Git book (free and good), and like it so  far. So I guess the important thing is 
        that I am gaining skills, and, importantly, have the opportunity to put them to (good) use.
    </p>
    <p>I
        I have not written anything here in a very long time, more than 6 months, but I should get back to it. Not only will it be faster and 
        more efficient with Git, but I can post it all (once I figure out how, that is) on GitHub Pages! This is getting more a diary than 
        a notebook where I share what I learn, which was what I had intended at first. But that's OK; probably no-one will see this anyway!
    </p>
    <p>And now, I'll commit this...</p>
